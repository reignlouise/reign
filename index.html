      <h3>An Introduction to Gender Issues</h3>
      <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/defscAMhUkg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Gender issues refer to the problems and challenges faced by individuals based on their gender identity, expression, or gender roles. Throughout history, gender norms and stereotypes have been used to dictate what it means to be a man or a woman, and these norms have often been rigid and limiting.</p>
      <p>For example, in ancient Greece, men were expected to be strong, stoic, and aggressive, while women were expected to be submissive, emotional, and nurturing. Women who didn't conform to these gender roles were often ostracized or punished.</p>
    <p>In the Middle Ages, gender norms were even more strict, with men expected to be warriors and women expected to be homemakers. Women who worked outside the home were often seen as immoral or promiscuous.</p>
      <p>In the Victorian era, gender norms were even more restrictive, with women expected to be demure, modest, and submissive, while men were expected to be confident, assertive, and dominant. Women who didn't conform to these gender roles were often shamed and stigmatized.</p>
      <p>Throughout history, gender norms and stereotypes have been used to justify discrimination and inequality. For example, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, women were often denied the right to vote, own property, or access education. They were also subjected to forced sterilization, abortion, and other forms of gender-based violence.</p>
      <p>In recent years, there has been a growing movement to challenge traditional gender norms and stereotypes. This movement, known as gender equality, seeks to promote equality and justice for all individuals, regardless of their gender.</p>
      <p>So, to sum it up, gender issues in historical periods have been a major concern for many people, and it's important to continue working towards gender equality.</p>

      <p>Our chosen final solution to the root cause of the problem which is ‚ÄúGender Norms and Stereotyping During the Historical Period‚Äù is to raise awareness about gender equality.</p>

Promoting Gender Equality: A Systematic Review of Interventions. Social Justice Research, 35(3), 318-343</a>
    <p>Guthridge et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review of interventions aimed at reducing gender inequality, gender bias, or discrimination against women or girls. They found that education and media interventions were effective in improving gender inclusion, but most gender mainstreaming interventions had only partial beneficial effects on outcomes.</p>

      <p>The European Institute for Gender Equality stated that ‚ÄúGender awareness raising means providing reliable and accessible information to build a better understanding of gender equality as a core value of democratic societies. As a gender-mainstreaming method, gender awareness raising is crucial for integrating a gender perspective into policies, programmes, projects and services that respond to the different needs of women and men.‚Äù</p>

     <p>According to Plan International, an organization that advances children's rights and equality for girls founded in 1937 in their official website, it stated that "A great way to make a big effect in the pursuit of gender equality is to join with others. Seek out local campaign groups. Join or set up school or university societies for gender equality and female leadership. There is strength in numbers, more voices tackling a particular issue means they are more likely to be heard. Helping to raise the profile of campaigns by other marginalized groups is a vital part of ending discrimination."</p>
